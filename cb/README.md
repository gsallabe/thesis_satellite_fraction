# What are we doing?

At a high level we want to build a mock universe for Song to test his cluster finder on.

We start with an N-body simulation.

Put galaxies in with behroozi functional form. And the scatter.

Match the SMF and the counts in cylinders with HSC.
We also have the SMF from HSC.

We then compare the 3d clustering (just in one radial bin, with a redshift cut) in the simulation to ???


Fix beta and gamma in Behroozi functional form.

1Mpc and 10Mpc for cic.

Put in Rsd and some percentage have only photoz
